# Components

## Introduction

Form builders are responsible for all front-end and control panel forms. They let you easily create and update model objects.

Typically they are used in conjunction with `streams` but are versatile enough to accommodate API driven /non-model forms as well as fully manual assembly.

### Components

Form components are objects that comprise the forms primary functionality. For example fields, sections, and actions (like submit) are all components of form builders.
  
### Definitions

Component `definitions` are basic array or string values that describe the component. The build process takes the component definitions and builds actual classes based on that `input`.

For example the following streams field could be defined for a form like this:
 
```php
protected $fields = [
    'first_name',
];
```

Note that only the field slug is needed by default. The rest of the information is automated based on the fields stream data.

You can easily override the above field as needed. Let's say the assignment is not required therefore the field is not required by default. We can easily change that by overriding the configuration:

```php
protected $fields = [
    'first_name' => [
        'required' => true,
    ],
];
```

This concept can be taken even further if you like; until you eventually define the entire field manually:

```php
protected $fields = [
    'database_driver' => [
        'label' => 'Database Driver',
        'instructions' => 'Specify the database driver you would like to use.',
        'type' => 'anomaly.field_type.select',
        'required' => true,
    ],
];
```
