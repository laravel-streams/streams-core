The Streams platform is added to existing Laravel projects as a dependency by requiring it with Composer.

```bash
composer require streams/core
```

You might consider starting with the [Streams starter application](/docs/installation).

## Updating

From within your project, use Composer to update individual packages:

```bash
composer update streams/core --with-dependencies
```

You can, of course, update your entire project using `composer update`.
